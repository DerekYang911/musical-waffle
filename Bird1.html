    <h1>Peregrine Falcon</h1>
    <p>The reason I like the Peregrine Falcon is because of the incredible speed and agility it displays while hunting. Known as the fastest bird in the world, it can reach speeds of over 240 miles per hour during its characteristic hunting stoop (a high-speed dive), making it a marvel of aerodynamics and precision. The Peregrine Falcon has keen eyesight that allows it to spot prey from great distances, and its powerful talons and beak make it a formidable predator. Found on every continent except Antarctica, this bird is a testament to adaptability and resilience, having made a remarkable recovery from the brink of extinction due to pesticide use in the mid-20th century.</p>
